that 和which 作为定语从句的引导词或关系代词区别如下：

一、只能用that的情况：

①先行词为不定代词all, much, something, everything, anything, nothing, none, the one等。

1.We should do all that is useful to the people .

2.There's nothing that can be said about it .

3.Do you mean the one that was bought yesterday?

②先行词被only, any, few, little, no, just, very, one of等词修饰时。

1.The only thing that we could do was to wait.

2.That's the very word that is wrongly used.

3.You can take any seat that is free.

4.I hope the little that I can do will be of some help to them.

③先行词是序数词时或被序数词修饰时。

1.When we talk about Wuxi, the first that comes into mind is Tai Lake.

2.This is the third film that has been shown in our school this term.

④先行词是最高级或被最高级修饰时。

1.This is the best that can be done now.

2.The most important thing that should be done right now is how to stop him from going on.

⑤先行词既有人又有物,用which和who都不适合,这时宜用that。如：

1.The writer and his novel that you have just talked about is really well known .

2.The rider and his bike that had run over an old woman were held up by the police.

⑥被修饰词为数词时.

Yesterday I caught two fish and put them in a basin of water. Now you can see the two that are still alive.

⑦如果有两个从句,其中一个关系代词已用which ,另一个关系代词宜用that,以避免语言的单调或重复.

Edison built up a factory which produced things that had never been seen before.

⑧疑问词是who或which,关系代词宜用that,以避免重复.

1. Which is the book that you like best?

2. Who is the man that is standing at the gate?

⑨主句是There be 结构,修饰其主句的定语从句宜用that 作关系代词。如：

1. There is still a seat in the corner that is still free.

⑩被修饰成分为表语时,或者关系代词本身是定语从句的表语时,该关系代词宜用that .

1. That's a good book that will help you a lot.

2. My home village is no longer the place ( that ) it used to be.



二、只能用which的情况：

①当关系代词的前面有介词时.

1.A zoo is a park in which many kinds of animals are kept for exhibition.

2.Is this the room in which Mr. White lives?

②在非限制性定语从句中.

1.Crusoe's dog, which was are now very old, became ill and died .

2.More and more people are beginning to learn English, which is becoming very popular in our country. (which指代主句)

③在一个句子中有两个定语从句,其中一个定语从句的关系代词用了that, 另一个宜用which .

1. Let me show you the novel that I borrowed from the library which was newly open to us.

2. At the station I bought some magazines that might help me to pass the time on the train and which I could pass on to others when I finished them.

④当关系代词后面带有插入语时.

1. Here's the English grammar which, as I have told you, will help improve your English.

⑤先行词本身是that, 宜用which .

What's that which she is looking at?

⑥先行词是those+复数名词.

You should grasp those skills which may be used in the future work.



另外，当先行词是表示原因或方式的名词时，可以用that引导定语从句，相当于介词+which，that可以省略。

如： She likes the child for the very reason that (=for which) she loves his father. 她喜欢那个孩子因为她爱着孩子的父亲。

He didn't like the way that (=in which) she speaks to his mother. 他不喜欢她对他的母亲那样说话。

Imagine the speed that (=at which) he drives the car. 很难想象，他开车开得那么快。

The reason (that /for which /why) he came here was to ask for our help.他来这里的原因是寻求我们的帮助。







-------
一. 形式不同

限制性定语从句紧跟先行词之后，无逗号。

非限制性定语从句与所修饰成分之间，有逗号隔开。

二. 功能不同

限制性定语从句，对先行词进行限定修饰。

非限制性定语从句，对先行词进行解释说明。

三. 先行词不同

1. 非限制性定语从句，先行词通常是专有名词以及独一名词。如 father （爸爸只有一个），之后接定语从句，一定加逗号。该定语从句就是非限制定语从句。专有名词或独一名词本身具有特殊性，不必再加限制性定语从句进行限定。

例句：

He has been to New York（专有名词）, which is a big city.

他去纽约了，那是一个大城市。

Here comes my father（独一名词）， who is an engineer.

我父亲来了，他是一名工程师。

2. 限制性定语从句，先行词为一般名词且本身不具有特殊性，可用限制性定语从句加以限定修饰。

例句：

I like the book which he gave me on my birthday.

我喜欢生日那天他送我的那本书。

若一般名词之前已有形容词加以修饰具有特殊性，或该名词本身就具有特殊性，定语从句可根据个人喜好选择限制性定语从句或非限制性定语从句均可。

例句：

I like that nice book which he gave me on my birthday.

我喜欢生日那天他送我的那本好书。

I like that nice book , which he gave me on my birthday.

我喜欢那本好书，那是生日那天他送给我的。

四. 翻译不同

非限制性定语从句，单独拿出来翻译，与主句译为两句话。

限制性定语从句，放在先行词之前，译为“......的”。具体参照上面例句。

五. 含义不同

比较：

I have a sister who is a nurse.

我有一个护士的姐姐。（姐姐不止一个）

I have a sister, who is a nurse.

我有一个姐姐，她是护士。（只有一个姐姐）

六. 关系词不同

定语从句九大关系词分为：

关系代词（that, who, whom, whose, which, as ）

关系副词 （when, where, why）

其中that 和why 不能用于非限制定语从句。
